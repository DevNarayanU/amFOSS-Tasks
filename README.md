# Amfoss-tasks

## INTRODUCTION

Myself, Dev Narayan U ,  a first-year BTech Coputer Science and Engineering undergrad at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. I know beginner-level coding and my preferred language is Python. My hobbies include playing badminton and singing ,Also I am really commited on putting the hardwork and giving my best on every task I am given.

## **Why should we choose you?**

I believe in commitment, consistency, and discipline. During the Praveshan tasks, though lacking ,I’ve tried my best to post updates regularly and to attend all mentor meetings. I’m eager to learn and adapt to new technologies. My passion for exploring new ideas keeps me motivated and always learning. I’m confident I can be a valuable asset to the club, and I’m ready to put in the hard hours with pleasure.

## **How do you intend to contribute back to the club?**

I will actively participate in discussions, activities, and events hosted by the club. I can assure you that I will not be the person who leaves after a month, realizing the amount of work required. I am willing to put in the hard work and dedicate the hours, as I believe that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction – the universe will reward you. Also, my passion for technology drives me to enter various competitions, and I will use these opportunities to represent and promote the club, amFOSS.

## **What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?**

My field of interest lies in both ai and computer programming , which explains why I ended up in my BTech branch. When it comes to computers, my interest lies in Python, ai integration.  I don’t know much about ai yet, but I am eager to grasp its knowledge. Additionally, my field of interest includes joining the amFOSS club because it’s the only club I want to join so badly. On a different note, I also want to achieve a better health routine and better singing over time and am committed to working for it.


## **What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?**
From the beginning it was a club everyone was aiming to get into > After some time I became able to see people forgetting the initial spark that they had on their day one . Now I see why the coordinators have arranged such tight tasks which can be simple and hard  depending on the candidates mentality, for that I am grateful for the club to show me the parts where my incompetence lie and I can imrove .
